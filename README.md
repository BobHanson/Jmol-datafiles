# Jmol-datafiles

The set of data files used to test Jmol using JUnit testing in connection with the Jmol-SwingJS project,
which is expecting the Jmol-datafiles directory in effectively a separate project directory.

see Jmol-SwingJS/test/org/jmol/adapter/smarter/TestJmolSmarterJmolAdapter.java

# Instructions

1) Import this project as git/Jmol-datafiles  (it must have this name).

2) run test/org/jmol/adapter/smarter/TestSmarterJmolAdapter.java as a JUnit test. 

If for some reason you need a different name, just adjust the file name declaration at that start of that java file.
